# Coffee Break

An Arkanoid-style game I created using CoffeeScript. View it [here](http://ggruiz.me/coffee-break
)!

After all these years I finally actually got into game development.

# TODO
* Add more advanced collision detection for the corners of blocks/the bat
* Change vectors for striking the ball moving
* More dynamic vectors as opposed to just 4 directions
* Add sound
* Cooler transitions between levels
