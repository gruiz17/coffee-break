# Coffee Break

An Arkanoid-style game I created using CoffeeScript. View it [here](http://ggruiz.me/coffee-break
)!

After all these years I finally actually got into game development.

# Attributions/Credits, Tech used
* [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) for the sound effects.
* Built with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), minimal [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and HTML5 Canvas/Sound

# TODO
* Add more advanced collision detection for the corners of blocks/the bat
* Cooler transitions between levels
